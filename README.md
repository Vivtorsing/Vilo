Vilo is a simple desktop app that I created just to learn Electron and definitely not because I was too lazy to sign back into to Trello... Anyways a simple place to keep track of your tasks and progress offline! 

Still more stuff todo like small bug fixes and visual improvements but I want to show it off a bit. I wonder what I should add next???
